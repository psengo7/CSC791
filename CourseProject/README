# DIRECTORY STRUCTURE:



# HOW TO RUN PROGRAM: 
* use optimization to take pre-trained model and apply pruning or quantization: 
* retrain the new model using SRCNN train method
* test the model using SRCNN Test method
* try inference using SRCNN inference method
* save model to onnx using optimize.py

# TODO

# Things Tried:
REAL-ERSGAN 
* L1Norm pruning (failed due to taking too long 1+ day)
* Level Pruning (Failed as program stated there is no mask - might be due to issues with nni wrapping objects)
* RDN (64, 128, 3, 3)
* RDN - caused bluing effect where images appeared with blue tint. 

# Model Testing: 
* run original model and see if super resolution actually occurs
* convert original model to onnx and try on xgen to see if speed test work
* run model with pruning and see if pruning can occur.
