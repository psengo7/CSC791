# DIRECTORY STRUCTURE:



# HOW TO RUN PROGRAM: 

# TODO
* Test pruning method
* Finish results method
* Move dataset download location for dataloader to be user specified

# Things Tried:
REAL-ERSGAN 
* L1Norm pruning (failed due to taking too long 1+ day)
* Level Pruning (Failed as program stated there is no mask - might be due to issues with nni wrapping objects)
* RDN (64, 128, 3, 3)

# Model Testing: 
* run original model and see if super resolution actually occurs
* convert original model to onnx and try on xgen to see if speed test work
* run model with pruning and see if pruning can occur.
