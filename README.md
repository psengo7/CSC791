All unit projects for this class are listed below: 
* P1: gives accuracy and inference time of pruned MNIST pretrained model for different pruning methods in nni library.
* P2: gives accuracy and inference time of quantized MNIST pretrained model for different quantization methods in nni library.
* P3: gives hyper parameter optimizations for learning rate and batch size using different HPO tuners. 
* P4: gives accuracy and inference time of pruned + distilled Mnist pre-trained model and also gives inference time for tvm optimized model
